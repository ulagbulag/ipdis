## License

* IPDIS Modules (`ipdis-modules-*`) and all other utilities are licensed under either of
    - Apache License, Version 2.0, ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or
    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

    - MIT license ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or

The reason for the split-licensing is to ensure that for the vast majority of teams using IPDIS to create feature-chains, then all changes can be made entirely in Apache2-licensed code, allowing teams full freedom over what and how they release and giving licensing clarity to commercial teams.
